# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022
My solution of [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in Python and some maybe in C. 

## Dislamer
Some solutions may not be perfectly correct and they are definitly not the easiest, fastest or the most beautiful solutions. I just wanted to put it on github.
Also I'm not saying that I'm going to implment all of them :D

## Run
Python 
```console
cd <day>
python puzzle{1 or 2}.py
```

## Aditional info
Coded with Python 3.11.1.
Coded on Windows 10.
